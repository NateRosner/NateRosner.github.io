Elevator Pitch: 

  As a student at Williams, it is often difficult to find engaging classes outside our major requirments. Some students, including myself, can find it difficult to find classes that are unique and interesting as sort of a break from the strict rigor of completing one's major. CSCI103 is quite frankly the best class for someone like me, who wants to take advantage of the divisional requirments while also learning skills that can be applied to my daily life. At the end of the semester, I will be able to do things that have required outside assistance throughout my life. I accidentally ripped my sports coat before a big interview? No problem, I will know how to fix it. Don't know where to complain about the Green Bay Packers after another horrific loss? I will be able to build a website that is programmed for mad Packers fans all across the world. Moreover, CSCI103 is a class I thought I would never be able to take. It is a special privelege to be at Williams College, with so many unique classes. Therefore, I had no choice but to atleast try my hand at Computer Science, switchboards, and sewing.
