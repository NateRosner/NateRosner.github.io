This is my Sweater Weather C-Program GitHub post. I have included the debug console screenshot below. A tip/hint that I would give me past self is to remember to name the file with a ".c" at the end of it. It seems without that I kept getting a launch.json error. I am not exactly sure what that means, but I think the message I am trying to convey is to not skip over the little steps. It is the little things that matter in assignments.
