This is my sewing sampler assignment. I have included pictures of both the front and back of my sampler below. One trick I learned throughout this VERY long process for past me was to not view this as an assignment, but learning a hobby during my free time. I had initially viewed this assignment as something I had to do, and was getting very angry because I had 5 other assignments to do but was stuck on learning to sew. Once I viewed it as something I can do in my free time, it went much better!
