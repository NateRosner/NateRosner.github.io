This is my first post on my website! My name is Nate Rosner. I am currently a second-year at Williams College. I intend to declare Political Science and Chinese as my majors at Williams College. I have zero sewing experience. I also have zero programming experience. Hopefully this post works and I can say I have a little programming experience. I wanted to take this class because it was something I have never done before. I have never sewed or programmed. I think it is cool I can do something like this class at Williams College. I am excited to gain some experience in these areas! My boring fact about me is that I play football and baseball here at Williams College.

How about a picture to see if it works?
